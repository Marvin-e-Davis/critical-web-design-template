    <h3> Known for his impressive anonymous digital art, Banksy ellusively
    posts interesting, thought provoking, and messermizing peices on a blog.
    While the Internet allows for anonymous behavior, it's interesting how Banksy
    has avoided being discovered by tech heads capable of finding who is responsible
    for posting his content, and revealing them to the public. </h3>

    <h3> Unlike other porfolio websites, Wim Delvoye decided to make his unique

    his portal to his library of art to a Sim City like environment. This intriguing
    website allows users to click on any building or object which leads you to a
